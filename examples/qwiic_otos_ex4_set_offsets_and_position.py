# qwiic_otos_ex4_set_offsets_and_position.py
#
# This example demonstrates how to set the offset and position of the SparkFun
# Qwiic Optical Tracking Odometry Sensor (OTOS).

# If your OTOS is mounted to a robot and is not centered, you can specify the
# offset for the sensor relative to the center of the robot; rather than
# returning the position of the sensor, the OTOS will calculate and return the
# position of the robot's center. If you know where your robot is located,
# such as the starting location or from another sensor, you can send that
# position to the OTOS and it will continue to track from there.

    # Assuming you've mounted your sensor to a robot and it's not centered,
    # you can specify the offset for the sensor relative to the center of the
    # robot. The units default to inches and degrees, but if you want to use
    # different units, specify them before setting the offset! Note that as of
    # firmware version 1.0, these values will be lost after a power cycle, so
    # you will need to set them each time you power up the sensor. For example, if
    # the sensor is mounted 5 inches to the left (negative X) and 10 inches
    # forward (positive Y) of the center of the robot, and mounted 90 degrees
    # clockwise (negative rotation) from the robot's orientation, the offset
    # would be {-5, 10, -90}. These can be any value, even the angle can be
    # tweaked slightly to compensate for imperfect mounting (eg. 1.3 degrees).

    # another source of location information (eg. vision odometry), you can set
    # the OTOS location to match and it will continue to track from there.
